# FloydHub Examples

A collection of ready-to-run machine learning and deep learning models using FloydHub.

## Getting Started

If you are new to FloydHub, we recommend [creating a free account](https://www.floydhub.com) so that you'll be able run jobs and workspaces on our service.

## Examples

Each example provides a one-click "Run on FloydHub" button. When you click this button, you'll automatically open up the project in a [Workspace](https://docs.floydhub.com/guides/workspace/) on FloydHub. Behind the scenes, FloydHub will:

* Prepare your Workspace's environment and machine, including installing any specified libraries or dependencies
* Download the project's code from GitHub to the cloud Workspace
* Attach any datasets specified in the project's floyd.yml config file to the Workspace
